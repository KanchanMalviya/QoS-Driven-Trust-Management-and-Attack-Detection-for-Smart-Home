# QoS-Driven-Trust-Management-and-Attack-Detection-for-Smart-Home
In this project, we have implemented QoS feature extraction, trust score computation, Isolation Forest weak labelling, and Random Forest supervised learning for the detection of IoT attacks. Features a real-time Streamlit dashboard for trust, QoS trends, and device-level risk analysis.
